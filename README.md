- Markov Decision Processes (MDPs)
- Value functions and policies
- Key algorithms: Dynamic Programming, Monte Carlo methods
- Temporal Difference Learning (Q-learning, SARSA)
- Practical implementation with GridWorld

### Lesson 2: Deep Reinforcement Learning
- Neural networks for value function approximation
- Deep Q-Networks (DQN) and its variants
- Policy gradient methods (REINFORCE, Actor-Critic)
- Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)
- Implementation with PyTorch/TensorFlow using OpenAI Gym
- Case study: training an agent to play Atari games

### Lesson 3: Advanced Topics and Applications
- Multi-agent reinforcement learning
- Hierarchical RL
- Meta-learning and transfer learning
- Real-world applications:
  - Robotics
  - Recommendation systems
  - Healthcare
  - Finance
- Current research trends and challenges
- Final project: implementation of a traffic signal control system

```

## üîç Getting Started

1. Begin with Lesson 1 to understand the fundamental concepts
2. Complete the practice exercises at the end of each lesson
3. Proceed to Lesson 2 to learn about deep reinforcement learning
4. Finally, explore the advanced topics in Lesson 3
5. Choose one of the final project ideas to apply what you've learned

## üìä Code Examples

Each lesson includes code examples to help you understand the concepts:

- Lesson 1: Simple Q-learning implementation for GridWorld
- Lesson 2: DQN implementation with PyTorch for CartPole
- Lesson 3: RL application for traffic signal control

## üèÜ Projects

Here are some project ideas to apply your reinforcement learning knowledge:

1. **Multi-Agent Game**: Implement a simple multi-agent environment and train cooperative or competitive agents
